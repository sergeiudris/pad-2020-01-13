# pad

personal scratchpad-lib

## rationale

- intended for personal use (re-use) on initial stages of projects
- iterate and change eagerly, avoid legitimization of bad habbits and lack of design
- once a project deepens, remove dependency on pad
- use to increase speed, transparency, to consolidate
